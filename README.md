# Magnetometer-Arduino-LEDArray
A magnetometer drives a 144-LED NeoPixel array via an ArduinoMicro board.
 
Uses an AAL004-10E, the worldâ€™s smallest high-performance magnetometer IC. To show the output, we use a meter-long 144-LED array.

The Arduino Micro-type board, which uses an ATmega32U4 processor, is ideal for these sensors because these processors have 
integrated differential amplifiers.
