# Magnetometer-Arduino-LEDArray
A magnetometer drives a 144-LED NeoPixel array via an ArduinoMicro board.
 
Uses an AAL004-10E, the worldâ€™s smallest high-performance magnetometer IC. To show the output, we use a one-meter long, 144-LED array.

The ATmega32U4 processors in Arduino Micro-type boards are ideal for these sensors because they have 
integrated differential amplifiers.
